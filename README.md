# Heptad paper Thoms et al 2020
This repo contains the computational analyses for Figs. 1 and 4 of the paper by Thoms J. et al (2020).

The repo is organised as follows:

- `heptad` contains the scripts and Jupyter notebooks
- `data` containing the raw data (not all tracked)

Other folders - not tracked by version control - that are needed to execute the scripts are:

- `figures` which is where the paper panels will be put

The code folder `heptad` is organised as follows:

- `figures_paper` contains the scripts for figures 1 and 4
- `pilots` contains a few scripts that were used in early development
- `external` also contains notebooks and scripts used early to understand external data sources
- `processing` contains a script that preprocesses ATAC-Seq data towards figure making

The methods are also described in the manuscript, and of course please write us an email if you have questions or requests.
